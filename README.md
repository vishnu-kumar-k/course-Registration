# course-Registration

For running in the jupiter we need to install "pip install mysql"
First want to create a Database for it as of your wish
For running with an interface view "https://datatofish.com/executable-pyinstaller/"

First run table file for creating a Database in your machine
Then, the course file.
No need to run table file all the time.
